# **App Name**: PrintFlow

## Core Features:

- Job Card: Job Card Generation: Automatically create job cards with unique numbers, including details such as date, job number, customer name, job size, master sheet size, net quantity, gross quantity, paper GSM, and paper quality.
- Inventory Optimization: Inventory Optimization Tool: Input paper specifications (GSM and quality), and the tool will suggest the best possible master sheet size from available inventory, calculating the percentage of wastage, thus helping the job manager choose effectively.
- Template System: Template Selection: Allow pre-made templates for different job types (e.g., Golden Tray, Rigid Top and Bottom Box).  These templates will automatically populate the required processes and steps.
- Departmental Tasks: Departmental Task Management: Each department (Designing, Printing Front/Back, Coating, Die Cutting, etc.) receives tasks. They mark jobs as complete, automatically pushing the job to the next process.
- Production Planning: Production Planning Console: An admin interface to assign jobs to specific processes, schedule work for the coming days, and manage overall production flow, with fields for die assignment, and special ink pantone codes.
- Interlinked Cards: Interlinked Job Cards: Enable the linking of multiple job cards (e.g., Top wrapper, Bottom wrapper, Top Kappa, Bottom Kappa for rigid boxes) to track dependent processes that need to be completed together.
- Reporting: Reporting Dashboard: Give the ability to see throughput (cards created and completed per day)
